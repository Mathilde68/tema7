                <p>Don't piddle with them -- don't worry about them. Soft as a meadow. You know me -- I love water. Maybe we'll do some almighty mountains today. Where do the clouds live in your world? As usual, Bob's gonna do a big tree. Just make little X's, and we'll put in a happy little sky. Get nervous. This is how you make a giant cartoon figure. The round brush is so fun, let's go back to that. Today's such a wonderful day, let's just make a happy little painting. Throw in some happy little things wherever you want them. I wanna be careful to not let the color go past the tape. Isn't life wonderful?</p>

All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision. We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. </p>";
