                <p>Don't piddle with them -- don't worry about them. Soft as a meadow. You know me -- I love water. Maybe we'll do some almighty mountains today. Where do the clouds live in your world? As usual, Bob's gonna do a big tree. Just make little X's, and we'll put in a happy little sky. Get nervous. This is how you make a giant cartoon figure. The round brush is so fun, let's go back to that. Today's such a wonderful day, let's just make a happy little painting. Throw in some happy little things wherever you want them. I wanna be careful to not let the color go past the tape. Isn't life wonderful?</p>

You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision. We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them."

tekst2.innerHTML="And maybe, maybe, maybe... Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Learn when to stop. We don't have anything but happy trees here. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. Very easy to work these to death. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let your imagination be your guide. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful."
